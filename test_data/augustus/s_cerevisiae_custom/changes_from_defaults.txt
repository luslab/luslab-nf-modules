This "custom" AUGUSTUS model is exactly the same as the included
AUGUSTUS model "saccharomyces_cerevisiae_S288C", except for the
following changes:

	-only protein sequences are included in the output GFF
	-the number of alternative transcripts sampled has been
	reduced to 1, down from 100 (speeds up run time)
